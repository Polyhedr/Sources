\noindent
\textbf{\emoji{arrows-counterclockwise} Setup.} Shuffle the cards and deal them so that each player has a \textbf{3$\times$3 grid of face-down cards}. 
The remaining cards form the draw pile. Flip 2 cards from the draw pile face-up to create 2 discard piles.
\\
\\
\textbf{\emoji{game-die} Game Turn.} Players take turns. On your turn, you must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Take a card} from one of the discard piles or draw one from the draw pile.
    \item Then, use it to \textbf{replace} a card in your grid (and discard the old one) or discard it and \textbf{flip over} a card in your grid.
    Before discarding, look at your card and \textbf{choose} the discard pile carefully!
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\emoji{cross-mark} Removal.} As soon as 3 cards of the same value are adjacent (not diagonally), \textbf{they are discarded (into the discard pile in any order you choose)}.
\\
\\
\textbf{\emoji{stop-sign} End of Game.} Are all your cards flipped? The game ends for you. 
The others each play one more turn, then all remaining face-down cards are revealed.
\\
\\
\textbf{\emoji{dart} Objective.} Have the \textbf{lowest} score! 
Each zone of \textbf{adjacent cards of the same color} scores the value of the \textbf{highest card} it contains.
Each \textbf{dark card} adds one extra point.
\\
\\
\noindent
\emoji{pushpin} Shuffle and/or rebalance if one of the 3 piles is empty.
