\noindent
\textbf{\emoji{arrows-counterclockwise} Setup.} Shuffle the cards and deal 5 to each player. 
The rest forms the draw pile.
Flip the first card of the draw pile to create the \textbf{visible pile}, and next to it is the \textbf{hidden pile} (initially empty). 
The top card of the visible pile is the \textbf{reference}.
% You now have 3 stacks of cards at the center of the table.
\\
\\
\noindent
\textbf{\emoji{dart} Goal.} Get rid of all your cards.
\\
\\
\noindent
\textbf{\emoji{game-die} Game turn.} Take turns playing. 
During your turn, you can draw (from the draw pile) and/or play on one of the piles (face up/down on the visible/hidden pile).
For the visible pile, your card must match (\textbf{in number or color}) the reference (which is then updated).
\newpage
\noindent
\textbf{\emoji{lying-face} Liar.} If you play a card on the hidden pile, any other player can \textbf{challenge} by flipping it over.
\begin{itemize}
\item If the card matches the reference, the challenger \textbf{draws} a card.
\item Otherwise, the bluffer \textbf{draws} a card and \textbf{takes} another card at random from the \textbf{challenger’s hand}.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\emoji{right-arrow} After a challenge.} The flipped card becomes the new reference.
\\
\\
\textbf{\emoji{warning} No risk, no reward.} If the challenger is wrong, they cannot take a card from the honest player’s hand!
\\
\\
\noindent
\emoji{pushpin} A player playing their last card can still be challenged.
\\
\noindent
\emoji{pushpin} You can also win by correctly challenging with only one card left in hand.
