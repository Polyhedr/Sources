\noindent
\textbf{\emoji{party-popper} Unomito Variant.} Follow the classic Unomito rules, but with \textbf{only one hidden pile!} 
It is initialized with a \textbf{exceptionally face-up card} (the reference), even though players play their cards face-down on top of it.
\\
\\
\noindent
\textbf{\emoji{game-die} Turn of Play.} On your turn, \textbf{announce the number and color} of the card you are playing (e.g., 9 red, 10 green, etc.; \textbf{you can of course bluff} \emoji{wink}, but it must match the reference).
What you announce becomes the new reference for the next player.
\newpage
\noindent
\textbf{\emoji{lying-face} Liar.} As in classic Unomito, to challenge, a player flips over the card that was just played.
This card then becomes the \textbf{new reference} (and stays face-up). Players continue by playing face-down cards.
