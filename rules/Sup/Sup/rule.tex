\noindent
\textbf{\emoji{arrows-counterclockwise} Setup.} Shuffle the cards and deal 4 cards to each player. 
The rest form the draw pile. You will have \textbf{rows of cards} in your \textbf{play area}.
The top and bottom rows are the \textbf{active rows}.
\\
\\
\textbf{\emoji{minus} Row rules.} Rows are created \textbf{only at the top or bottom}, 
must always remain the \textbf{same color}, and are worth \textbf{their highest card} in points.
\\
\\
\noindent
\textbf{\emoji{joystick} Gameplay.}  
First turn: Play one card to create your first row and draw one card. 
Subsequent turns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emoji{warning} You \textbf{must} play a card in an opponent's area to create or increment an \textbf{active row}.
    \item \emoji{seedling} Play another card in your area to increment a \textbf{(active or inactive)} row or create a new row 
    (the former active row must have a card of the same value, \textbf{a 10, 11, or 12 cannot be played this way}). You may skip this step by discarding a card. End your turn by drawing 2 cards.
\end{itemize} 
\textbf{\emoji{stop-sign} End of the game.}
When a play area has 4 rows of different colors, the current round finishes normally, and other players each take \textbf{one final turn}.
\\
\\
\noindent
\emoji{pushpin} You may have multiple rows of the same color.
\\
\textbf{\emoji{pushpin} Inactive rows.} Place them aside in your area to make space, keeping only the highest value card for each row (the others are discarded).
